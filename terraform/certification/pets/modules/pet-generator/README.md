# Pets Generator
This is the cheapest way I could find to prepare for the Terraform Associate 
Certification without generating a Cloud Provider bill. Technically this is 
not a very representative module as it is a single resource.

## Variables
* pet_prefex: The first name of the pet we are generating a last name for

## Outputs
* pet_name: The name of the pet automatically generated. Some are actually 
entertaining.
